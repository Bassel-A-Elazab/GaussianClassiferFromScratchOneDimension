# Generative Model Approach

  - It’s simple, and powerful to build classifier.
  - It’s based on probability distribution.
  - It's a categorization of classifiers in Bayesian perspective. 
  - It's a statistical model of the joint probability distribution on P(X|Y)
  - Describes how data is generated, in terms of a probabilistic model.

# Example of generative classifiers:

    1 - naive Bayes classifier. </br>
    2 - linear discriminant analysis.</br>
    3 - Hidden Markov Models.</br>
  
 # The main idea:

    1 – fit the probability for each classes separately in our training data.</br>
    2 – fit the probability distribution for each classes in our training data.</br>
    3 – predict new point comes with maximize joint probability distribution.(Bayes' Theorem)</br>
 # How Generative model is classifying data in one dimension ?
 	- The Gaussian in one dimension is called Univariate gaussian.
	- It’s specified by just two parameter (mean, standard deviation)
  	- It used Bayes' rule for predicting/classifying new point.

	# Bayes’ theorem
