# Generative Model Approach

  - It’s simple, and powerful to build classifier.
  - It’s based on probability distribution.
  - It's a categorization of classifiers in Bayesian perspective. 
  - It's a statistical model of the joint probability distribution on P(X|Y)
  - Describes how data is generated, in terms of a probabilistic model.

# Example of generative classifiers:

  1 - naive Bayes classifier.
	2 - linear discriminant analysis.
	3 - Hidden Markov Models.
  
 # The main idea:

  1 – fit the probability for each classes separately in our training data.
	2 – fit the probability distribution for each classes in our training data.
	3 – predict new point comes with maximize joint probability distribution.(Bayes' Theorem)
